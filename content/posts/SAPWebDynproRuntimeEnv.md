## Remove User settings option

### ABAP Enviroment

#### Method 1

Modify the WebDynpro Application and add the Parameter:

â€‹	`WDDISABLEUSERPERSONALIZATION = X`.

![method1](/images/ABAP/ABAP_Webdynpro1.png)

#### Method 2

Alternatively  you can call the webdynpro application `WD_GLOBAL_SETTING` in `SE80 `and globally disable all user personalization for all applications. This avoids endusers from calling helpdesk because "fields are gone" etc. pretty well.

### JAVA Enviroment

#### Procedure

A number of settings allow you to influence the behavior of the Web Dynpro system configuration. This is done in the archive file **WebDynpro.war** . This file is part of EAR file **sap.com/tc~wd~dispwda.ear** and is automatically deployed on the SAP NetWeaver Application Server.

To configure a number of basic settings of the Web Dynpro runtime environment in file `default.properties`, the system administrator defines system configuration properties using **NetWeaver Administrator**.

1. Log in to **NetWeaver Administrator** either by choosing NetWeaver Administrator on your engine's **Start** page or by entering the following URL:`http://<your host name>:<port>/nwa`
2. In the top level navigation, select **Configuration Management** and in the second level navigation bar select **Infrastructure**.
3. Select **Application Modules** and in the **Module List** section enter `tc~wd~dispwda` (or parts of this string) into the filter row. The complete path name for the module is displayed: webdynpro/resources/sap.com/tc~wd~dispwda
4. In the **Web Module Details** section, select the **Web Dynpro Properties** tab and select **default** from the corresponding table.
5. In the **Full Details** section, navigate to the property you want to configure, and make the required entries.Such as : AllowUserPersonalization = false
6. To save your changes, select **Save** in the **Web Module Details** section.

#### Parameter Description

| *Parameter*                                      | *Description*                                                | *Default*                         |
| ------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------- |
| AccessibilityChecksEnabled                       | Specifies the whether accessibility checks are enabled.      | false                             |
| ActivateURLParameters                            | If set to false, the Web Dynpro runtime ignores some URL parameters that could be set. These URL parameters are, for instance, the sap.csf.* parameters and the sap.session.plugin parameter. It's recommended to keep parameter value false in order to deactivate URL parameters that might not be available in production mode. | false                             |
| AllowUserPersonalization                         | Enables the end user to implicitly configure the Web Dynpro interface, for example to adapt fields or tables. | true                              |
| AllowXMLHttpRequestForIE6                        | Specifies whether Web Dynpro is allowed to use an XMLHttpRequest object for IE6 user agents. In case ActiveX is not enabled for all such clients, you can use this switch in case of warnings or errors due to the use of an XMLHttpRequest object by Web Dynpro. | true                              |
| DefaultExpirationTime                            | Specifies the expiration time in seconds when no user interaction takes place. This default expiration time is used if an application does not specify its own expiration time explicitly.Valid values:Any positive integer number | 3600                              |
| DevelopmentMode                                  | Specifies whether the Web Dynpro runtime environment runs in a development mode, or not. This can affect how error messages are displayed. For example, the error message page provides detailed information about product, version, protocol, and stack trace when the Web Dynpro runtime environment runs in a development session. | true                              |
| IGSUrl                                           | Specifies the Web address of the Internet Graphics Service (IGS) valid for the application. This service supports the display of the UI elements *BusinessGraphics* and *GeoMap*. The URL of the IGS is specified according the following pattern: `http://<server host name><``fully qualified path name>:4<server instance number>80.``Example:` http://localhost:40080 | <empty>                           |
| InlineCSS                                        | Specifies whether the Web Dynpro runtime performs the optimization of inline CSS rendering. This affects server-side HTML rendering only. | true                              |
| Lightspeed                                       | Specifies whether the Web Dynpro runtime uses Unified Rendering's Lightspeed control framework (instead of classic UR). This affects server-side HTML rendering only. | true                              |
| UISecurityLevel                                  | Specifies the security level of UI security checks. UI security means that the framework checks whether a UI event is allowed in the current state of the UI element. Per default the Web Dynpro runtime throws an exception, if such a situation occurs.Valid values:integer value = 0, 1, 20 No Exceptions are thrown, if UI security is violated, but the violations are traced.1 Exceptions are thrown, if generic checks like enabled, isible and read only fail, other violations are traced.2 Exceptions are thrown, if any security violation is recognized.Note: You should only change the default, if the security exception is caused by framework bugs or known temporary inconsistencies. | 2                                 |
| ValidateByRendering                              | For the Web Dynpro application to be able to handle the errors caused during data retrieval, the Web Dynpro runtime executes the request for each data set before the call of the wdDoPostProcessing() method. In this context, the request process is referred to as *validation* (IWDNode.validate() method), while the response to the client is referred to as *rendering*. The default behavior during the validation phase requires all nodes in all visible views to be validated. | true                              |
| ZipResponse                                      | Specifies whether to send the data to the client zipped or unzipped. If this parameter is already defined in the http service in J2EE Engine, this parameter should be set to `false``.` | false                             |
| context.extended.validation                      | Enabling this property, node elements activate an extended sanity check on attribute access, for example regarding destruction of an element via eventing. | true                              |

| sap-ser-report-filetrc                           | Property used for serialization report: Write report into trace. If set to true, the serialization report is written into the `defaultTrace.trc` file under location `com.sap.tc.webdynpro.session.report`, severity level `INFO`. | false                             |
| sap-ser-report-filter                            | Specifies the problem filter which the monitor should take into account. Bit mask encoding:1 Class uses custom serialization (i.e. class is NOT shareable)2 Class loader is not shareable4 Class uses non trivial finalizer8 Class has serial persistent field16 Class has transient fields32 Super class does not implement serializable64 Object is not shareable due to a complex reason128 Class does not implement serializable (i.e. class is NOT serializable) 256 Object is not serializable due to a complex reason | 384                               |

| sap.cmi.useLongTexts                             | Messages being reported via an *ICMIMessageProvider*. can contain a short or a long message text. If you set this property to `true` you can achieve that the long message text is taken if available. | false                             |
| sap.default.authentication                       | Specifies whether all Web Dynpro application require authentication per default. If set to true, authentication will be required for all applications.

| sap.defaultMaxWaitTime                           | Specifies the maximum wait time when calling the system (in msec). If the request fails after this time interval, it will be ended with a LockException. | 10000                             |
| sap.domain.relaxation.blacklist                  | Specifies the blacklist of applications for which domain relaxation is not allowed. This property is only taken into account if the configuration parameter`sap.domain.relaxation.enabled` is set to true.Valid values:Comma-separated list of Web Dynpro applications, containing the DC name and the application short name (i.e. it is equal to the part of the application URL that follows `/webdynpro/dispatcher`).Examples:`sap.com/tc~wd~tools/Explorer` `sap.com/tc~wd~tools/WebDynproConsole` | <empty>                           |
| sap.domain.relaxation.enabled                    | Specifies whether domain relaxation is enabled or not. Using the parameters `sap.domain.relaxation.whitelist` and `sap.domain.relaxation.blacklist`, it is possible to specify a list of applications which are allowed to use domain relaxation, or for which domain relaxation is forbidden.`false`: the `sap.domain.relaxation.whitelist` is checked whether it contains applications for which domain relaxation should be allowed anyway.`true`: the `sap.domain.relaxation.blacklist` is checked whether it contains applications for which domain relaxation should not be allowed, although it is generally allowed. | true                              |
| sap.domain.relaxation.whitelist                  | Specifies comma-separated whitelist of applications for which domain relaxation is allowed. This property is only taken into account if the configuration parameter `sap.domain.relaxation.enabled `is set to false, i.e. if domain relaxation is generally not allowed.Valid values:Comma-separated list of Web Dynpro applications, containing the DC name and the application short name (i.e. it is equal to the part of the application URL that follows `/webdynpro/dispatcher`).Examples:`sap.com/tc~wd~tools/Explorer sap.com/tc~wd~tools/WebDynproConsole` | <empty>                           |

General activation should only be set for test purposes. | <empty>                           |
| sap.interoperability_arfc1_arfc2.mode            | Interoperability Adaptive RFC 1 / 2 by stateful connection sharing. General activation is only recommended for test purposes.Valid values:Off (default), filterDestinationName, filterModelName, on | off                               |

| sap.locking.maxWaitInterval                      | Specifies the maximum wait interval in seconds in the Web Dynpro locking system; needed for long-runners. This is especially needed for long-runners, for which request processing takes longer than 100 seconds. This property is usually not needed and should only be modified if long-runner applications are really used. | 100                               |
| sap.logoffURL                                    | Specifies the Web address of the standard logoff page displayed when the user terminates the application.Default Web page is /webdynpro/resources/sap.com/tc~wd~dispwda/global/logoff.htmPossible entries: Any valid absolute URLs | required                          |

| sap.msie.no-cache.workaround                     | Specifies when the workaround for a problem with Microsoft IE and https will be activated. Reason: Web Dynpro always adds the header "Pragma: no-cache" to every file transfer during download or file exchange with Adobe or office integration. IE refuses to accept a file if it is accessed via https and this header is present (http://support.microsoft.com/kb/812935). The workaround is not to add this header if the client is MSIE6. The Web Dynpro configuration parameter decides when to activate it. With default value auto the workaround will be activated if the request arrived via https. Administrators can set it to yes if there is a reverse proxy between browser and server that accesses the server via http, so that the server cannot see that the browser used https. | auto                              |
| sap.noClientURL                                  | If no clients are specified in Web Dynpro configuration file clients.properties, you can use this property to configure the displayed error page.Web page address:/webdynpro/resources/sap.com/tc~wd~dispwda/global/noclient.htmFurther possible values: Any valid absolute URL | Yes (required)                    |

This function is assigned to the component iView Runtime Java (IRJ) application. How this function is used depends on the configuration of the deployed portal. The runtime ID appears in the URL after http://<hostname>:<port>/ | irj                               |
| sap.previewMode.enabled                          | The preview mode enables features which where implemented as an outlook for upcoming functionalities. The use of those features is allowed for demo applications only. There is no support and no guarantee that these features will be available in later versions. | false                             |
| sap.protocolSchemeForADSCall                     | Specifies which port the Web service client addresses:ConfigPort_Document for http calls orSecConfigPort_Document for https calls.If the property has value `request`, the protocol with which the Web Dynpro application was started is used. An *http* setting forces the http protocol, even if Web Dynpro was called using https. Exception: There are methods in the Adobe Document Service that force https. Examples of these are suppressPrint, digital signatures, or certification. In this case, Web Dynpro switches to the https protocol itself.Summary valid values: request: same protocol scheme as current httpRequest from clienthttp: always http (as long as no secure function of ADS is used)https: always https | request                           |
| sap.resourceCache.deletionTime                   | Defines the time span (in secs) after which a cached resource is removed from the cache. If no value is set, the time span is 30 mins. | <empty>                           |
| sap.resourceCache.encryption                     | Defines whether the resources will be encrypted when dumped to a file. | <empty>                           |

| sap.sld.cacheInvalidationTime                    | Defines the invalidation time of cached SLD objects in seconds. If an unavailable SLD should always trigger an exception, this value must be set equally to the configuration parameter `sap.sld.cacheExpirationTime`.Valid values: Any positive integer number. | 86400                             |
| sap.systemLocale                                 | Specifies the standard language key that is used when no language key is provided by the user authentication or no value is set for the *Locale* configuration property of the application configuration. Therefore, a valid ISO Language code is needed. These codes are the lower-case two-letter codes as defined by ISO-639. You can find a full list of these codes at a number of sites, such as:http://www.ics.uci.edu/pub/ietf/http/related/iso639.txtValid values: A valid ISO language code (ISO-639) | <Locale of server VM>             |
| sap.techinfo.enabled                             | Specifies whether the *Technical Info* and its system menu entry are permanently enabled.Valid Values:`default`: The value is automatically determined by the Web Dynpro runtimetrue: permanently enabled`onRequest`: disabled until the user activates it for the duration of the current application by pressing both the `CTRL` and `ALT` keys while opening the context menu (right mouse click)`false`: permanently disabledCurrently the resulting value for `default` is `onRequest `for all system types. | default                           |
| sap.techinfo.manageExtensions                    | Specifies whether *Technical Info* allows to modify the set of active extensions within a running session. Requires that the *Extensions* tab is visible. If set to `default`, the resulting value is automatically determined by the Web Dynpro runtime.

For Development systems the set of extensions can be modified, for other system (Test, Productive), it is not shown.Valid Values:`default`, `true`, `false` | default                           |
| sap.techinfo.predefinedExtensions                | Comma separated list of predefined *Technical Info* extensions.All specified extensions are activated when the *Technical Info* is opened for the first time in a session. There are no further checks, esp. the other configuration entries `showExtensions`, `manageExtensions` are not checked. The purpose of this configuration is to allow the extensions of the *Technical Info* with a set of trusted extensions that should be available in every Web Dynpro session.Be careful when extending this list. Only add trusted components.Default Value is not defined, might vary from release to release.Valid Values: no fixed value setFormat of Entries:`QualifiedNameOfExtensionComponent '@' EngineApplicationName` The `QualifiedNameOfExtensionComponent` is a Java qualified name, the `EngineApplicationName` is the name of a deployment unit in the format as shown in the NetWeaver Administrator.If the configured list starts with a '`+`', then the configured extensions are added to the SAP defined list of extensions, otherwise the SAP defined list is replaced by the configured list.Example:`co``m.mycompany.TechnicalInfoAddOn@``mycompany.com/techinfo~plugin` | default                           |
| sap.techinfo.showExtensions                      | Specifies whether the list of *Technical Info* extensions is displayed in its own tab.If set to default, visibility is determined by the Web Dynpro runtime automatically. | default                           |
